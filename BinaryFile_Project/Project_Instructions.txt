The File
The file you are to read, modify, and save is a binary file that contains a sales list. A binary file is
a non-text file, meaning some things (like numbers) aren’t stored as digits but as the ints/floats
you use as variables. The name of the files to read and write will be in Util.h.

The file will be structured like this:
Field		Size		Type		Purpose
HEADER

NumEntries	4 btyes		Integer		Tells you how many
						entries you need to
						read.

ENTRY(repeated
NumEntries
times)	

Date/Time	sizeof(time_t)	Time		Timestamp (#
						seconds since
						1/1/1970)	

Item ID		sizeof(int)	Integer 	Item's code

Item Price 	sizeof(float)	Float		Price of the product

Item Name	50 bytes	char*		Name of the item sold

The goal is to copy the file. While making the copy, you will change two items:

1. Modify the last existing entry, making these changes:
	a. Price: 1,000,000
	b. Name: “CS 3377”

2. Add this info:
	a. Time 1613412000 (2/15/2020 6 PM GMT)
	b. ID 6530927
	c. Price: 89.99
	d. Name “Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment by Stevens and Rago”
	[warning: this is more than 49 characters!]

Be sure to update the total number of entries to account for these new ones.
Part 1 (Due 3/29)
You will read in the file (Util::inputFileName), add/update the two entries, and save the file
(Util::outputFileName) using open(), close(), read(), and write().

You must use the low-level functions we will talk about in APUE chapter 3 (open, close, read,
write). Failure to do so will result in 0 points for this part of the project.

It is highly recommended that you do the file reading and writing in class(es) outside
Part1SimpleFileModifier, as that code will be useful later.
